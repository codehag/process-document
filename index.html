<title>The TC39 Process</title>

<h1>The TC39 Process</h1>

<p>The Ecma <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/tc39.htm">TC39</a> committee is responsible for evolving the ECMAScript programming language and authoring the specification. The committee operates by consensus and has discretion to alter the specification as it sees fit. However, the general process for making changes to the specification is as follows.

<h2>Stages</h2>

<p>Changes to the language are developed by way of a process which provides guidelines for evolving an addition from an idea to a fully specified feature, complete with acceptance tests and multiple implementations. There are five stages: a strawperson stage, and 4 “maturity” stages. The TC39 committee must approve acceptance for each stage.

<p>Proposals at stage 1 and beyond should be owned by the TC39 committee. Upon proposal acceptance, any externally-owned repositories should be transferred by following the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposals#onboarding-existing-proposals">onboarding instructions</a>.

<p>* This column does not indicate a requirement for advancement, but simply a general expectation.

<h2>Input into the process</h2>

<p>Ideas for evolving the ECMAScript language are accepted in any form. Any discussion, idea, or proposal for a change or addition which has not been submitted as a formal proposal is considered to be a “strawperson” (stage 0) and has no acceptance requirements. Such submissions must either come from TC39 delegates or from non-delegates who have <a href="https://tc39.github.io/agreements/contributor">registered</a> via Ecma International.

<h2>Spec revisions and scheduling</h2>

<p>TC39 intends to submit a specification to the ECMA General Assembly for ratification in July of each year. The following is an approximate timeline for producing a new spec revision:</p>
<ul>
  <li>February 1: Candidate Draft is produced.</li>
  <li>February - March: 60 day royalty-free opt-out period.</li>
  <li>March TC39 Meeting: stage 4 proposals are incorporated, final semantics are approved, and the new spec version is branched from master. Only editorial changes are accepted from this point forward.</li>
  <li>April-June: ECMA CC and ECMA GA review period.</li>
  <li>July: Approval of new standard by the ECMA General Assembly</li>
</ul>

<h2>Status of in-process additions</h2>

<p>TC39 will maintain a list of in-process additions, along with the current maturity stage of each, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/ecma262">on its GitHub</a>.

<h2>Spec text</h2>

<p>At stages “draft” (stage 2) and later, the semantics, API and syntax of an addition must be described as edits to the latest published ECMAScript standard, using the same language and conventions. The quality of the spec text expected at each stage is described above.

<h2>Reviewers</h2>

<p>Anyone can be a reviewer and submit feedback on an in-process addition. The committee should identify designated reviewers for acceptance during the “draft” (stage 2) maturity stage. These reviewers must give their sign-off before a proposal enters the “candidate” (stage 3) maturity stage. Designated reviewers should not be authors of the spec text for the addition and should have expertise applicable to the subject matter. Designated reviewers must be chosen by the committee, not by the proposal's champion.

<p>When reviewers are designated, a target meeting for Stage 3 should be identified. Initial reviewer feedback should be given to the champions two weeks before that meeting to allow for a back-and-forth ahead of the meeting. The target Stage 3 meeting may be delayed by a champion outside of the meeting at a later time if it is not ready.

<h2>Calls for implementation and feedback</h2>

<p>When an addition is accepted at the “candidate” (stage 3) maturity level, the committee is signifying that it believes design work is complete and further refinement will require implementation experience, significant usage and external feedback.

<h2>Withholding Consensus for Advancement</h2>

<p>During the discussion of a proposal in a given stage any aspect may be discussed, including issues that will be of concerns in a future stage of the proposal. Concerns related to future stages are not sufficient grounds for withholding consensus. A proposal’s advancement may be "blocked", or consensus may be withheld, in the case that the proposal has flaws in its current design as outlined by the process stages. There are two forms that this can take: A constraint or a block.

A constraint is a restriction on the proposal, and may be used to withhold consensus for advancement. It takes the form of a well stated reason for why a proposal should not advance in it's present form, that is recorded by the committee. Well stated reasons should ideally illustrate the core issue of the constraint, this may be expressing a member industry position (such as a given design not working in the embedded space), a design concern, or a technical concern, and should provide an actionable plan whenever possible. The committee does not have an established concept of a rejected proposal.

A block is the same as a constraint, however it is presented in a non-actionable way, or it cannot be addressed in the current stage and requires significant rework. This requires the champion to rework the proposal at an earlier stage in order to address the concern.

In all possible cases, withholding consensus should take the form of a constraint. Blocks happen but should be avoided.

<p>When a champion proposes a feature for advancement, a delegate may pose additional constraints and ask that the champion incorporate them into the proposal. The delegate should expect to spend time working with the champion to help flesh out the constraint and learn about other constraints that went into the proposal.

<p>For features advancing from Stage 1 to Stage 2, a delegate may pose a constraint as necessary for advancement to Stage 3. In this situation, the delegate should expect to work with the champion and other delegates during Stage 2 to incorporate their constraint into the solution. In general, this is a good time to pose new constraints.

<p>For features advancing to Stage 3, a delegate may ask that the champion work with them to incorporate a new constraint as a condition of advancement to Stage 3. In particular, given that consensus on Stage 3 means "the solution is complete", i.e., all open design issues havee beeen resolved including anticipated implementation and ecosystem compatibility issues, all TC39 participants should validate the design of proposals they care about before granting Stage 3 consensus.

<p>Delegates should openly give feedback on proposals, especially when they have significant concerns, and especially for a proposal for stage advancement where the concern is relevant to the stage. Even if a Delegate does not intend to withhold consensus they should raise their concerns for general discussion.

<p>A delegate may also request additional time to consider the proposal.

<p>Conditional advancement is time-limited, giving the person raising the concern time to discuss with the champions and authors about their concerns. If a proposal has a conditional advancement, an issue must be opened on the proposal’s repository. If the issue is resolved, the proposal automatically reaches the next stage without further discussion by the committee. If the issue cannot be resolved, the proposal does not advance.

<p>The committee must record a good description of why a proposal did not advance, both in the meeting notes and within an issue in the proposal's tracker, but not limited to those. So that in future meetings and future proposals we can learn from failed proposals, and have a good record of why they failed.

<p>In order to ensure that the committee is able to do it's work effectively, there are restrictions to witholding consensus.

<p>The ability to withhold consensus for reaching stage 1, 2 and 3 is not limited but constraints introduced should be weighed according to their stage. Proposals which have fulfilled the acceptance criteria may be blocked from advancement for any well stated reason.

<p>The ability to withold consesus for reaching stage 4 is limited. Proposals which have fulfilled the acceptance criteria may not be withhold advancement unless the constraint is related to implementation experience or identifies an issue or information which has not previously been discussed by the committee. Withholding consensus for stage 4 advancement is limited, as during stage 3 implementers  is to allow implementers to invest in implementations, and maintain the significance of stage 3 in the process.

<h2>Reverting to Earlier Stages</h2>

<p>At any point in the process, a proposal may be downgraded from its current stage in the case that a well stated reason identifies an earlier stage as appropriate, with an issue that may have not been considered, or identified, before.

<h2>Scope of Responsibility for Champions</h2>

<p>Champions are trusted to resolve smaller issues on their own without reference to the committee. Such issues are <em>nits</em> and may be raised at committee or in the proposal's issue tracker. Examples of <em>nits</em> are issues of taste such as minor naming adjustments.

<h2>Test262 tests</h2>

<p>During stage 3, <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262">test262</a> tests should be authored and submitted via pull request. Once it has been appropriately reviewed, it should be merged to aid implementors in providing the feedback expected during this stage.

<h2>Eliding the process</h2>

<p>The committee may elide the process based on the scope of a change under consideration as it sees fit.

<h2>Role of the editors</h2>

<p>In-process additions will likely have spec text which is authored by a champion or a committee member other than the editors although in some cases one or more of the editors may also be a champion with responsibility for specific features. The editors are responsible for the overall structure and coherence of the ECMAScript specification. It is also the role of the editors to provide guidance and feedback to spec text authors so that as an addition matures, the quality and completeness of its specification improves. It is also the role of the editors to integrate additions which have been accepted as “finished” (stage 4) into a new revision of the specification.
